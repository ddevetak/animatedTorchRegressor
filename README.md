# animatedTorchRegressor

The below code perform an animated fit of a random function using a pyTorch fully connected network. 
```
python animatedRegressor.py
```
For relatively complex function like *sin(x^2)* the network performs well for a higher number of steps.

For higher complex function like *cos(x^3)* the network model under-fits.
